= How can I limit file size? =

To limit file size in `multiple file upload` field generator under Contact Form 7, there's a field `File size limit (bytes)`.

You can also manually add limit parameter in existing [mfile] tag.

Example: *[mfile upload-file-433 limit:20971520]* - This limit the user to upload upto 20MB only.

Please take note it should be `Bytes` you may use any converter just Google (MB to Bytes converter) default of this plugin is 5MB(5242880 Bytes).

= How can I limit the number of files in my Upload? =

You can limit the number of files in your file upload by adding this parameter `max-file:3` to your shortcode :

Example: *[mfile upload-file-344 max-file:3]* - this option will limit the user to upload only 3 files.

= How can I change text in Drag and Drop Uploading area? =

You can change text `Drag & Drop Files Here or Browse Files` text in Wordpress Admin menu under `Contact` > `Drag & Drop Upload`.

= How to Display Links in an Email =

Some email servers have limitations on file attachment sizes (e.g., Google allows a maximum of 20-25 MB). Attaching large files to emails can be problematic. Consider using this option to display links in the email instead of attaching the files.

Go to WP Admin `Contact -> Drag & Drop Upload` settings then check "Send Attachment as links?" option.

To manage mail template, go to Contact Forms edit specific form and Select `Mail` tab. In `Message Body` add generated code from [mfile]. ( Example Below )

Message Body : [your-message]

File Links 1 : [upload-file-754]
File Links2 : [upload-file-755]

Note : No need to add in `File Attachments` field.

See [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvuvmzIImYo&t=232s)

= How to Attach Files to an Email =

1. In order to attach files to email you will need to check and make sure **"send as file(s) as links"** option is unchecked.
2. Go to Wordpress admin menu "Contact -> Edit {specific_form}" click or hover the cf7 form you want to edit.
3. In **"Edit Contact Form"** page click "Mail" tab and in the bottom you will see **"File attachments"** field, on this field add your upload field name (ie: **[upload-file-xxx]**), you will find the upload name in **"Form"** tab generated from `[mfile]` shortcode.
4. If attaching multiple files from a different file upload just add all the upload fields name. (see example below)
File attachments: `[upload-file-111] [upload-file-222]`
